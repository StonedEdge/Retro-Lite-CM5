### Current Status
The shell is complete. Rear triggers have been tweaked to work better than previous versions, but always open to feedback and improvements here. 

As for the enclosure, I will add two versions (one with DPAD on top, one with DPAD on bottom) for those who would like to use a DPAD top version. Right now, the only version uploaded has the DPAD on the bottom.
