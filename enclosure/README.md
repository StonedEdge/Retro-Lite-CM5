### Current Status
The shell is complete. Rear triggers are slightly too loose. They will work as is but still need to tweak the design to make them tighter and prevent forward and backward "sliding movement". 

As for the enclosure, I will add two versions (one with DPAD on top, one with DPAD on bottom) for those who would like to use a DPAD top version.
