### Current Status
The shell is complete. Rear triggers have been tweaked to work better than previous versions, but always open to feedback and improvements here. 

After assembling v1 and running tests, I am working on improvements to the design which will be uploaded to STL_v2 folder. It is recommended to assemble v2 only (v1 is now deprecated).
