v1 STLs include files used for the v1 alpha build. The design has a few things mounted to the rear shell which were improved in v2 (i.e the battery, fan and volume/power flex board all mount to rear in v1, which was not ideal for assembly purposes). v1 uses a 5000mAh battery, whereas v2 has now upgraded to a 6000mAh battery for improved battery life. v2 also has no components mounted to the rear shell which makes for a much easier assembly process. Recommended to use v2.
