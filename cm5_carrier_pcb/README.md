## What is this folder?
Note: The current files are now tested and verified to work with Radxa v2.2 carrier boards. **Also now verified to work Radxa V2.21 boards!**

This folder contains the BOM, EAGLE schematic (.sch) and board (.brd) files, as well as pick & place files to order the board with JLCPCB or your fab of choice. 
The main carrier board is a 6-layer board and you should order the board with impedance matching, according to the JLC06081H-2116 (Standard) stackup offering (0.8mm thickness). 
Currently, this version is only compatible with the Radxa CM5 (version X2.2/X2.21) & I have not tested it with other SoMs, like the Raspberry Pi CM4. 

Expect to pay around $250 per board to have it fabbed and turnkeyed with JLCPCB.
