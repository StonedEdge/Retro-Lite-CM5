## What is this folder?
This folder contains the BOM, EAGLE schematic (.sch) and board (.brd) files, as well as pick & place files to order the board with JLCPCB.
The main carrier board is a 6-layer board and you should order the board with impedance matching, according to the JLC06081H-2116 (Standard) stackup offering (0.8mm thickness). 
Currently this version is only compatible with the Radxa CM5 (version X2.2) & I have not tested it with other SoMs, like the Raspberry Pi CM4.
